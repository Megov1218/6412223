Why are DSA essential :- 
Effecient operations for large datasets.
Time Optimisation and Space optimisation
Preventing crashes

Suitable Data Structures:- 
Arraylist:- 
Easy to implement but slow search or update 
HashMap :- 
Best for update , delete using product id as key 
best case scenerio for all operations is O(1)
Worst case Scenerio is ( only in the case of hash collision) is O(n)
