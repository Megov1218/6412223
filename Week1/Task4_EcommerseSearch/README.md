What is Big O Notation (Asymmpptotic Notation)? :- 
Big O notation tells how fast or slow an algorithm works,
to compare between different ways to solve the question and 
choose the best approach .

O(1) idicates constant time
O(log n) indicates logarithmic time (Binary Search)
O(n) indicates Linear (Linear Search)
O(n^2) indicates Nested Loops

| Search Type   | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Linear Search | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       |
| Binary Search | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   |

Binary search is faster than linear, but needs a sorted array
